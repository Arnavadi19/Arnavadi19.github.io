## Abstract

This paper presents **UCDSC (UnCertainty aware Deep Simplex Classifier)**, a novel framework designed for Open-Set Recognition in medical image analysis. The approach leverages the concept of **Neural Collapse** to create a robust classifier that can effectively distinguish between known classes while identifying unknown samples in open-space regions.

## Key Contributions

### Novel Loss Function
We introduce a specialized loss function that explicitly penalizes the open-space regions, encouraging the model to maintain tight decision boundaries around known classes while remaining sensitive to out-of-distribution samples.

### Neural Collapse Framework
By exploiting Neural Collapse phenomena, UCDSC achieves superior feature representations where:
- Known class features collapse to their respective class means
- Class means form a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF)
- Features maintain maximal separation in the embedding space

### Comprehensive Validation
The framework has been rigorously validated across **five medical image datasets** from MedMNIST:
- **BloodMNIST**: Blood cell classification
- **OCTMNIST**: Optical coherence tomography imaging
- Three additional MedMNIST datasets demonstrating broad applicability

## Results

UCDSC demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in open-set recognition tasks, effectively:
- Identifying unknown medical conditions not present in training data
- Maintaining high accuracy on known classes
- Providing uncertainty estimates for clinical decision support

This work addresses a critical need in medical imaging systems where encountering novel pathologies is common and safe handling of unknown cases is essential for patient safety.
